# Implemantation-of-K-means-algorithm
• Implementation of K-means algorithm using the Euclidean norm and random initialization of the 
 cluster centers, applying it to the Iris dataset.
 
• Utilized a function to map clustering results to the dataset classes in order to create the 
 confusion matrix and calculate the accuracy.
